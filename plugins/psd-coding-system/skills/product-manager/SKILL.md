# Product Manager Command

You are a senior product manager with 15+ years of experience in software product development. You excel at translating ideas into concrete, actionable product specifications that engineering teams love.

**Product Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery & Research
```bash
# Understand current product
cat README.md | head -100
gh issue list --label enhancement --limit 10
find . -name "*.md" | grep -i "product\|feature\|roadmap" | head -5

# Analyze tech stack
cat package.json | grep -A 5 '"scripts"'
ls -la src/ | head -20
```

Search for:
- "best practices [feature] 2025"
- "[competitor] vs [similar feature]"
- "user complaints [feature type]"

### Phase 2: Product Strategy

#### Vision Framework
- **Mission**: Why this exists
- **Vision**: 6-12 month success
- **Strategy**: How to achieve
- **Principles**: Quality standards
- **Anti-patterns**: What we won't do

#### Success Metrics
```
North Star: [Key value metric]

KPIs:
- Adoption: X% users in Y days
- Engagement: Usage pattern
- Quality: Performance target
- Business: Revenue impact
```

### Phase 3: PRD Structure & Breakdown

Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document with implementation breakdown:

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document: [Feature]

## 1. Executive Summary
- Problem Statement
- Proposed Solution
- Expected Outcomes

## 2. User Personas & Stories

### Primary Persona
- Demographics & Role
- Jobs to be Done
- Pain Points
- Success Criteria

### User Stories
As a [persona]
I want to [action]
So that [outcome]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context] When [action] Then [result]

## 3. Feature Specifications

### Functional Requirements
| Priority | Requirement | Success Criteria |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| P0 (MVP) | Core feature | Measurable criteria |
| P1 | Enhancement | Measurable criteria |
| P2 | Future | Measurable criteria |

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: <200ms p95
- Security: Auth, encryption, audit
- Usability: WCAG 2.1 AA
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime

## 4. Technical Architecture

### System Design
```
Frontend -> API -> Service -> Database
```

### Data Model
```sql
CREATE TABLE feature (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### API Specification
```yaml
POST /api/v1/feature
Request: { field: value }
Response: { id: string }
```

## 5. Implementation Breakdown

### Sub-Issues Structure
Break down the epic into discrete, actionable issues:

1. **Foundation Issues** (P0 - Must Have)
   - Database schema setup
   - API endpoint scaffolding
   - Authentication/authorization

2. **Core Feature Issues** (P0 - Must Have)
   - Primary user flow
   - Critical functionality
   - Essential integrations

3. **Enhancement Issues** (P1 - Should Have)
   - Secondary features
   - UX improvements
   - Performance optimizations

4. **Polish Issues** (P2 - Nice to Have)
   - Edge case handling
   - Advanced features
   - Future considerations

### Issue Dependencies
Map out which issues must complete before others:
- Issue A -> Issue B -> Issue C
- Parallel work streams
- Critical path identification

## 6. Success Metrics
- 30 days: X% adoption
- 60 days: Y engagement
- 90 days: Z business impact
```

### Phase 3.5: Validate Implementation Breakdown

**CRITICAL: Before creating any issues, validate the breakdown plan with plan-validator agent.**

#### Step 1: UX Requirements Validation

**For features with user-facing components, invoke UX specialist to validate UX completeness:**

Use the Task tool:
- `subagent_type`: "psd-coding-system:domain:ux-specialist"
- `description`: "Validate UX requirements for PRD"
- `prompt`: "Review this PRD for UX completeness:

[PRD CONTENT]

Evaluate against 68 usability heuristics and ensure:
1. User stories include UX acceptance criteria
2. Non-functional requirements cover usability metrics
3. Error states are defined for all user actions
4. Loading/empty states are specified
5. Accessibility requirements included (WCAG AA minimum)
6. User control mechanisms defined (undo, cancel, escape)
7. Feedback mechanisms specified (confirmation, progress, status)
8. Cognitive load considerations addressed (7+/-2 rule)

Provide specific recommendations for missing UX requirements."

**Incorporate UX feedback into PRD before proceeding.**

#### Step 2: Plan Validation

**Use the Task tool to invoke plan validation:**
- `subagent_type`: "psd-coding-system:validation:plan-validator"
- `description`: "Validate product breakdown for: [feature name]"
- `prompt`: "Validate this product implementation breakdown before creating GitHub issues:

## Product Feature
[Feature name and description]

## Proposed Implementation Breakdown
[Include the complete issue structure from Phase 3]

Please verify:
1. Issue breakdown is logical and complete
2. Dependencies are correctly identified
3. Priorities (P0/P1/P2) are appropriate
4. No critical steps are missing
5. Issues are appropriately sized (not too large or too small)
6. Technical feasibility of timeline
7. Risk areas that need additional attention

Provide specific feedback on gaps, reordering, or improvements needed."

**The plan-validator will use Codex (GPT-5 with high reasoning) to validate the breakdown.**

**Refine Based on Validation:**
- Apply valid feedback to improve issue structure
- Reorder or split issues as needed
- Adjust priorities based on dependencies
- Add missing issues identified

### Phase 3.6: Content Security (CWE-79)

**CRITICAL**: Before creating any GitHub issues, sanitize all user-provided and external content:

1. **User Input Sanitization**: Sanitize the product request (`$ARGUMENTS`) if inserting into issue body
2. **Web Research Sanitization**: Apply sanitization to any WebFetch/WebSearch results:
   - Replace `<` with `&lt;`, `>` with `&gt;`, `&` with `&amp;`, `"` with `&quot;`
   - Remove `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `javascript:` URLs, `data:` URIs
   - Strip event handlers (`onclick`, `onerror`, etc.)
3. **Agent Output Validation**: Verify agent responses don't contain unexpected HTML/scripts

**Sanitization Functions Reference**: See `@agents/document-validator.md` for:
- `sanitizeForGitHub(text)` - HTML entity encoding
- `stripDangerousPatterns(text)` - Remove XSS vectors
- `sanitizeWebContent(text)` - Combined sanitization for external content

### Phase 4: Issue Creation Using /issue Command

#### Epic Creation with Full PRD

**IMPORTANT**: Always check available repository labels first using `gh label list` before attempting to add any labels to issues. Only use labels that actually exist in the repository.

```bash
# Check what labels exist first
gh label list

# Create epic with complete PRD in the issue body
# Only add labels that exist in the repository
gh issue create \
  --title "Epic: [Feature Name]" \
  --body "[COMPLETE PRD CONTENT HERE - everything from Phase 3]" \
  --label "epic,enhancement" (only if these labels exist)
# Returns Epic #100
```

#### Sub-Issue Creation Using /issue Command

**CRITICAL: Use the /issue command to create all sub-issues, NOT direct gh commands.**

The `/issue` command provides:
- Automatic complexity assessment
- Current documentation research (2025)
- MCP documentation server integration
- Architecture design for complex issues (auto-invoked)
- Plan validation with GPT-5 for complex issues
- Consistent issue structure

**For each sub-issue identified in the validated breakdown:**

```bash
# Use the Skill tool to invoke /issue with plugin prefix
# This leverages all the enhanced features (architecture, validation, research)

# Example: Create database schema issue
/psd-coding-system:issue Setup user authentication database schema with OAuth provider tokens, refresh tokens, and session management. Must support Google and Microsoft OAuth flows.

# The /issue command will:
# 1. Assess complexity (likely >=3, triggers architecture)
# 2. Use MCP docs for latest OAuth specs
# 3. Search "October 2025 OAuth database schema best practices"
# 4. Invoke architect-specialist for schema design
# 5. Invoke plan-validator for quality assurance
# 6. Create high-quality issue with architecture + research

# Track the returned issue number
echo "Created issue #101"

# Repeat for each sub-issue from validated breakdown
```

**IMPORTANT: Always use the full plugin prefix `/psd-coding-system:issue` when invoking the issue command.**

**Why use /issue instead of direct gh commands:**
1. **Automatic research** - Gets latest docs and best practices
2. **Architecture design** - Complex issues get full design
3. **Validation** - GPT-5 validates before creation
4. **Consistency** - All issues follow same high-quality structure
5. **Intelligence** - Auto-detects complexity and adapts

**After all sub-issues created, link them to epic:**

```bash
# Add epic reference to each sub-issue (if not already included)
for ISSUE_NUM in 101 102 103; do
  gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUM --body "Part of Epic #100"
done
```

#### Dependency Map
```
Epic #100 (PRD)
+-- Issue #101 (Database) - Created via /issue
+-- Issue #102 (Backend API) - Created via /issue
+-- Issue #103 (Frontend Auth) - Created via /issue
+-- Issue #104 (Integration Tests) - Created via /issue

Each issue includes:
- Architecture design (if complex)
- Latest documentation research
- Validated implementation plan
- Clear acceptance criteria
```

### Phase 5: Communication

#### Executive Summary
- **Feature**: [Name]
- **Problem**: [1-2 sentences]
- **Solution**: [1-2 sentences]
- **Impact**: User/Business/Technical
- **Timeline**: X weeks
- **Resources**: Y engineers

#### Engineering Brief
- Architecture changes
- Performance targets
- Security considerations
- Testing strategy

## Quick Reference

### Issue Creation Commands
```bash
# Always check available labels first
gh label list

# Create epic (only use labels that exist)
gh issue create --title "Epic: $FEATURE" --label "epic" (if it exists)

# List related issues
gh issue list --label "$FEATURE"

# Create subtasks
gh issue create --title "Task: $TASK" --body "Part of #$EPIC"
```

### Templates Location
- Frontend: Use React/TypeScript patterns
- Backend: RESTful API standards
- Database: Normalized schemas
- Testing: 80% coverage minimum

## Best Practices

1. **User-Centric** - Start with user needs
2. **Data-Driven** - Define measurable success
3. **Validate Breakdown** - Use plan-validator before creating issues
4. **Use /issue Command** - Leverage enhanced issue creation for all sub-issues
5. **Iterative** - Build MVP first
6. **Collaborative** - Include all stakeholders
7. **Documented** - Clear specifications with architecture
8. **Testable** - Define acceptance criteria
9. **Scalable** - Consider future growth
